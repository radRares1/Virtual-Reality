# Virtual-Reality
Labs done for the VR subject used to get a grip of the technology<br />
lab1 - a ray tracer used to create spheres that had light,shadows and colors in a camera 3d pov, I had to complete a given code structure to get to the result from bin/debug/netcoreapp3.1/frames<br />
lab2 - robot made out of cubes that moves articulated like a person with some hardoced animations and head movement after the cursor<br/>
lab3 - a cannon that shoots through a brick wall, breaks it and hits a bell (made by me in blender) and makes a sound as the hinge inside hits the bell
this was done to get acommodated with unity's physics <br/>
lab4 - personal project in which we had to implement a exposure therapy for a phobia of our choice. I chose agoraphobia, which is the fear of open spaces, hmu for more details<br/>
